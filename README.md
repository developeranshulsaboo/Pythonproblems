Here you will find the solution for python problems that are displayed which I solved

1. ### IO Jaddoo and DNA transcryption:
  Key points for the solution are.
  1. Create a empty string as a output at the begining
  2. Scan the string using for loop
  3. If the target character is found on the string replace by the given conditional character
  4. In case the string does not contain the target character print invalid input
  
 2. ### IO Jaddoo Vs Koba Challenge
   Key points for the solution are.
   1. Use the range function
   2. Ord function will tell the number associated with the character
   3. Either you must refer the character table or try each range to get correct output
