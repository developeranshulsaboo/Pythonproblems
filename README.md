# Python Problems

Here you will find the solution for python problems that are displayed which I solved

### IO Jaddoo and DNA transcryption:
  Key points for the solution are.
  1. Create a empty string as a output at the begining
  2. Scan the string using for loop
  3. If the target character is found on the string replace by the given conditional character
  4. In case the string does not contain the target character print invalid input
  
  
### IO Jaddoo Vs Koba Challenge
   Key points for the solution are.
   1. Use the range function
   2. Ord function will tell the number associated with the character
   3. Either you must refer the character table or try each range to get correct output

### IO Jaddoo Hates Numbers
   Key points for the solution are.
   1. Ord function will give you ASCII value for letter F
   2. To Print 420 either you can add the ord function 6 times / multiply it

### IO 13 Reasons why
   Key points of the solution are.
   1. Use split function while taking input rather than taking 3 inputs one by one
   2. To simplify the swap declare another variable d

### HR List Comprehensions
   Key points of the solution are.
   1. Mentioned in the program
   2. X + 1 is used because range starts indexing from 0 and we want to cover x,z,y as well

### HR Runner up Score
   Key points mentioned in the program refer to the program
   
### HR List
   Key points of the solution are.
   1. First convert the string command to list using split()
   2. Use if-else as switch case is not available in python
